# simplenote_srv

__attempt to create a SimpleNote server clone (at least the api part)__

## features

- aims to be 100% compatible with simplenote api (this means you should be able to point your simplenote client to the address of this server and it will work out of the box)
- multiuser, secure, etc...
- scalable with mongodb, and flask structure

## dependencies 

The following software and libraries are used:

- python3
- mongodb
- python-pymongo
- python-flask
- python-urllib
- python-bcrypt

## TODO

- sanitize data on update and create
- more testing!
- find more info on api to fix any potential issues (be more compatible)
